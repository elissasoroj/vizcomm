Below are a list of course learning objectives for all students. 1-3 additional learning objectives will be identified by you and the instructor at the beginning on the course. These learning objecives will form the basis of how your work will be assessed. Student Learning Objectives By the end of the course, students will be able to: Utilize a working understanding of digital image files, including file types, size, resolution, and software used to generate these files. Implement color theory Create vector illustrations in Affinity Designer or Adobe Illustrator. Design and utilize a custom-build theme in Keynote or other presentation software to create a cohesive and effective presentation Communicate their own research with confidence, utilizing custom-made visual aides to communicate ideas clearly for their intended audience Evaluate the effectiveness of visual media based on visual and conceptual clarity. Grading This course is built on the idea that feedback and iteration are essential for effective communication. Therefore, the importance of assignments and presentations, in terms of their impact on your grade, increases throughout the semester. There are four ways you will recieve points in this course: completion points for illustration assignments throughout the semester, graded presentations, a participation grade, and a graded final portfolio. See the assignment list for point and grade % breakdowns for each portion. Completion Points All visual deliverables recieve a completion grade for the first draft. Your illustration must meet minimum requirements laid out in the rubric for each assignment in order to earn completion points. You will recieve feedback on all of your assignments within a week of turning them in and can incorporate these edited assignments into your final portfolio. Presentations Each presentation will be graded with the final presentations worth twice as much as the first two. General expectations for presentations are outlinedd in the Presentations section of the syllabus, but specifics will also be covered in class and provided via the Assignments Module ahead of presentation dates. Rubrics for each presentation will also be provided. Participation The participation grade reflects the verbal and written feedback you provide to your peers throughout the course. Specifics are provided in the Participation section. Final Portfolio The purpose of completion grades throughout the semester is to give you the opportunity to refine your work and present it as a complete portfolio at the end of the term. Ideally, much of the work that will go into your final portfolio will be completed throughout the semester. For some of the work included in your portfolio, you will be required to write a summary of how you changed the wokr to incorporate feedback from the instrructor and your peers. Refer to the Final Portfolio section for completet details. Assignment List This is a simplified list of the assignments, the points they are worth, the learning objectives (LOs) they address, and the preferred software for each assignment. Bolded assignments will be evaluated for a grade, the rest will recieve completion points.

As you can see, the instructor is available for drop-in office hours twice every week, or by appointment. You are required to attend in-person office hours at least once during the first two weeks to establish your additional learning objectives for the semester.

During the first 1/3 of the course we will cover the basics of both forms of communication by formalizing personal aesthetics, creating presentation templates in Keynote (or presentation software of choice), and learning how to use a handful of tool in Affinity Designer (or vector software of choice). The last 2/3 of the course will consist of in-class presentations, design principles, and collaborative work. The calendar below lists the dates of each lecture (white) and assignments.

The course is designed to reflect similar activities these students are likely to encounter in an academic career (e.g. as a postdoc, professor, researcher, etc) and match the pace of work in an academic environment. Students will learn two suites of skills: vector illustration and verbal slide presentation. The goal is to give them a solid foundation in the minimum number of tools necessary to produce effective visual illustrations and then have them practice using those visualizations while developing verbal presentation skills. The entire course is scaffolded, such that most initial assignments (awarded completion points) will be incorporated into future graded assignments. The students are give the opportunity to shape their own learning by defining their own learning objectives early in the semester, guided by a one-on-one meeting with the professor. Additionally, course content will be tailored to the interest of the students based on the pre-course survey results and initial meetings. The plan is to convince Columbia (or whichever institution) to buy licenses for all the software, which will increase accessibility for the students. Meetings : Tuesdays and Thursdays 10am-noon Location : Schermerhorn Ext. 1012 Instructor : Elissa Sorojsrisom ( ess2239@columbia.edu ) Office Hours : Mondays 2-4pm, Friday 9-11am or by appointment Course Requirements : You should be involved in research and interested in communication. You will need access to a computer and the ability to install software onto that computer. If this poses a challenge for you please reach out to the instructor, who will work with you to find a solution, This is an advanced seminar, designed for no more than 12 students. The target audience is students involved in science research, although students from other disciplines may be admitted to the course. A major outcome of this couse is to provide students with the tools, skills, and confidence to produce visuals and utilize them effectively in presentations of their research. This course is designed for advanced students involved in research who are interested in learning how to communicate scientific ideas visually. Visual communication includes supplementary images that may be used in presentations and documents, figures appropriate for publication in scientific journals, and high-level conceptual diagrams which convey complex concepts. In this course you will not only learn how to create these images, you will learn visual literacy: the ability to find, interpret, evaluate, and use visual media effectively. You will practice communicating topics relevant to your own research to your peers and play an important role in providing feedback to them as they do the same. The only requirement for this course is that you are involved with research and interested in communicating science topics. No background in art or visualization is expected. This course will be challenging, requiring substantial work and preparation outside of class. You will be expected to take your role as a student and a peer seriously and contribute to a welcoming and constructive learning environment for all. Please note, this is not a data visualization class and though the visualizations we create in this class may include data (e.g. graphs, tables, etc) at times, this course will not cover the creation of data visualizations. Instructor Information Elissa Sorojsrisom is a joint graduate student in the E3B (Ecology, Evolutionary, and Environmental Biology) Department at Columbia University and the New York Botanical Garden.
