# Course Structure & Schedule

This course is roughly broken up into two categories: <span style="color:cornflowerblue;">*verbal*</span> and <span style="color:lightcoral;">*visual*</span> communication. Of course, these two forms of communication overlap heavily, but for the purposes of this course these categories refer to the form of *presentation*. 

## Week
This class meets for 2 hours twice a week. The first class period each week will cover <span style="color:cornflowerblue;">verbal communication</span> and the second will cover <span style="color:lightcoral;">visual communication</span> (i.e. illustration).

As you can see, the instructor is available for drop-in office hours twice every week, or by appointment. You are *required* to attend in-person office hours at least once during the first two weeks to establish your additional learning objectives for the semester. Each students' unique learning objectives will be posted on the course website in the [People](/people/) section and will inform the feedback you recieve from your peers. If you cannot make the schedule office hours times, please email the instructor to arrange a time to meet. 


## Semester
The semester is roughly divided into two sections. During the first 1/3 of the course we will cover the basics of both forms of communication by formalizing personal aesthetics, creating presentation templates in Keynote (or presentation [software](/software/) of choice), and learning how to use a handful of tool in Affinity Designer (or vector [software](/software/) of choice). The last 2/3 of the course will consist of in-class presentations, design principles, and collaborative work. 


The calendar below lists the dates of each lecture (white) and assignments. Assignments in <span style="color:cornflowerblue;">blue</span> are due on Tuesday and assignments in <span style="color:lightcoral;">red</span> are due on Thursday. Refer to the [Assignments Module](/assignments/) for due dates and more details.  

*Note:* Some lecture topics may be subject to change based on the interests of the students indicated in the pre-course survey!
