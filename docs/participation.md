# Participation 
Participation is an integral part of this course and will consitute 20% of your total grade. 
## Basics
1. Attend every class period
2. Arrive on time and stay for the entire duration of the class meeting time
3. Pay full attenion to the presenter - NO SCREENS OF ANY KIND
4. Complete each assignment to the best of your ability
5. Provide feedback on all the work of your peers, as detailed below

## Presentations
1. Directly following each presentation, there will be at least 5 minutes allocated for audience questions. Although it is unusual for everyone to be comfortable speaking in this context, building the ability to give concise, actionable feedback verbally is one of the objectives of the course - so you should strive to participate in verbal feedback at least twice every session. 
2. Within two days of every presentation session, you will be asked to hand in a bullet-point list of feedback for each of your peers. Your participation grade will depend on the quality of your written feedback. Please note, this feedback will be pooled and anonymized by the instructor and given to the presenter. 

## Illustrations
1. Prior to each presentation, presenters will upload any visuals they created so that it may be evaluated ahead of time, outside of the context of the presentation. Only a figure caption is allowed. All students are expected to evaluate this work *prior* to the presentation and provide written feedback via Slack. Please allow yourself enough time to give thoughtful feedback. 

Failing to adhere to these requirements will negatively impact your participation grade. You will be informed if your participation is not satisfactory for a given week. You may enquire about the state of your participation grade at any point during the semester in office hours or via email.
