# Presentations

When you present a departmental seminar, conference, or public talk you are representing your lab, your institution, and scientists generally. Sound intimidating? It should be!

Every presentation should be taken seriously and you should prepare for it accordingly. The purpose of the presentations in this course are to improve your presentations skills, yes, but more importantly - to help you identify your presentation strengths and weaknesses so that you can anticipate challenges and allocate your effort accordingly when you prepare for presentations in the future. 

You will give three presentations throughout the year, one in each of the following categories: narrative, persuasive, and informational. 

## Tips for Success
1. Dress for success
	This doesn't have to mean a suit or business-casual attire, but you should strive to look professional whenever you present. Remember, you are speaking to your audience as an authority on science and you want to command their respect. Dressing well won't just help your audience's perception of you, it'll make *you* feel more prepared and comfortable. **Pro Tip**: try to reflect some of your personality in they way you dress. 
2. Prepare your slides well in advance
	It is a running joke that all scientists go home early the night before their conference presentation to put their slides together. Don't be that person. Not only will you miss out on a great networking opportunity: drinking beer with your colleagues, you will be stressed, unable to prepare properly, and likely go to bed late. 
	In this course, you will be required to upload your slides at before 5pm the day before each presentation. This counts towards your presentation grade. 
3. Prepare your talking points
	In this course, we will walk through preparing outlines and scripts together - but in the wild you'll have to do this yourself. Make sure you prepare the amount of notes that is appropriate for your presentation style. Some people prefer general talking-point reminders so they can keep a casual, conversational tone while others (like myself) need to prepare entire scripts lest our minds go blank as we flounder under the blank stare of our audience. We will talk about differentt appproaches in lecture.

## Presentation #1: The Personal Narrative
You may think that as a scientist, you will not have much opporunity or need to present a personal narrative. However, eventually you will be pitching yourself as a candidate for job positions in which your ability to come across as a well-rounded and genuine person who also does incredible research will likely give you a leg-up over other candidates. Additionally, scientists have long struggled with making their research accessible and relevant to a general audience. *You* are the thing that every audience member can relate to best, so learning how to leverage your personal narrative as a gateway to making your research exciting will serve you. 

This will be a short presentation, introducing yourself and your research topic to the class. You will also share some of the illustratioins you have created thus far.

## Presentation #2: The Persuasive Pitch
An integral part of being a scientist is convincing others that your research matters so that they will give you money to keep doing it. Although most grant applications will be written, this is not a writing course - so you will have the opportunity to practice talking about the relevance and importance of your work in a verbal format. 

This presentation is still on the short side, which will forrce you to think about distilling your presentation down into the most relevant talking points.
